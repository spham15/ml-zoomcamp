# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Zoomcamp â€“ Homework & Projects

This repository contains my homework assignments, projects, and notes for [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp), a free 4-month practical course on **machine learning engineering** by DataTalks.Club.  

The course covers the full ML lifecycle â€” from model training and evaluation to deployment and production-ready serving.

---

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

**Topics covered:**
- Introduction to ML & CRISP-DM
- Regression & classification models (scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1, AUC, etc.)
- Feature engineering & model selection
- Deploying ML with FastAPI, Docker, and cloud platforms
- Decision trees & ensemble methods
- Neural networks & deep learning (TensorFlow & PyTorch)
- Serverless ML deployment
- Kubernetes & TensorFlow Serving
- Capstone project

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Clone this repo and set up dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ml-zoomcamp-homework.git
cd ml-zoomcamp-homework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Each module has its own `README.md` with instructions. Example:

```bash
cd module02-regression
jupyter notebook car_price_prediction.ipynb
```

## ðŸ“Š Highlights

- **Module 2 â€“ Regression:** Built a linear regression model for car price prediction; experimented with feature engineering & regularization.  
- **Module 3 â€“ Classification:** Created a logistic regression model for churn prediction; learned about categorical encoding & feature selection.  
- **Module 5 â€“ Deployment:** Packaged a model into a REST API with FastAPI and Docker.  
- **Midterm Project:** (To be filled once complete â€” e.g., fraud detection, house price prediction, etc.)  
- **Capstone Project:** (To be filled once complete â€” end-to-end ML system with deployment).
